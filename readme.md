# Write random line in a text file

This utility does the following:
* Reads the `data.txt` text file (which has to be in the same directory)
* Chooses a random line from that file 
* Writes that line to the `line.txt` file
* Waits a specific amount of time (default 5s) and starts from the beginning

You can either build it yourself or download a build from the builds directory

* [Mac x86](builds/obs-random-line-mac-x86)


Also download the example [data.txt](data.txt) file.
